## Investigating the cross-lingual sharing mechanism of multilingual models through their subnetworks

This work is part of the "Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics" course of the AI MSc programme at the University of Amsterdam.

### Description

This project focuses on finding and analyzing language-specific subnetworks for different NLP tasks. The task is to systematically study how subnetworks differ based on the language and task used for fine-tuning, e.g. some tasks might require more cross-lingual sharing than others or sharing between different types of languages. This repository contains the code for the aforementioned study along with some experiments and results.
