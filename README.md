## Description

This project focuses on finding and analyzing language-specific subnetworks for different NLP tasks. The task is to systematically study how subnetworks differ based on the language and task used for fine-tuning, e.g. some tasks might require more cross-lingual sharing than others or sharing between different types of languages. This repository contains the code for the aforementioned study.
